Raghav is organising a party, he wants to know whether the hall can be fully occupied or not. The hall can be assumed to be an n×n grid, where each person can stand on a 1×1 cell. Some cells of the hall are occupied by 1×1 tables hence people can't stand there.

Also, people can only enter the room in pairs. Raghav wants to make sure that people in a pair should stand adjacent to each other (horizontally or vertically, not diagonally). Can you help him find out whether such an arrangement exists or not.
