Aha as usual got bored of daily prep and also kind of migrated to leetcode - https://leetcode.com/aflahkhan/
Also sometimes I solve stuff on GFG - https://auth.geeksforgeeks.org/user/aflahkhan2020/practice/

A Repository where I commit my Daily Progress so that hopefully someday in the future I can look back and smile at this repository 

~(Ah is that cringe? Well nvm I'm still going to do it xD)~
